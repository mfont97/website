        <p class="lead mb-5">Hello and welcome! I'm glad you've decided to join me during my fourth year as a Statistics student attending the Universiy of Florida. These days, I spend much of my time either focusing on my statistics coursework or looking into new skills to further my professional development. Though the future is always filled with surprises, I constantly strive to better myself professionally in order to be both adaptable and effective. I hope to one day use the skills I learn to better the lives of others, be it in my immediate community or beyond.    </p>

            <p>During the summer of my junior year, I had the priveledge of teaching 3 two week sessions in Deep Learning techniques to high school students using Tensorflow/Keras. During this time I gave crash courses in ML math (linear algebra, statistics, calculus), introduced students to Python programming paradigms, and demoed several deep learning architectures (Feed Forward Multilevel Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Nets, Recurrent Neural Nets, and General Adversarial Networks). Though many of these topics are still actively being explored through research, it was rewarding to see young students take the challenge head on. They all picked up a lot more than I expected and managed to complete a final project. Projects included Music style learning RNNs, Image recognition with CNNs, and even a Data vizualization of New York traffic data segmented by average neighborhood income.   </p>

            <p>During my time at Wunderthought, I assisted a good friend of mine in developing his own business, Wundethought LLC. During the early days at Wunderthought, most of our efforts went into finding local businesses in the Greater Miami Area in need of an online storefront. Though most of my work at Wunderthought invloved web development, I also spent time acquiring new clients in need of our services. These days I am much less involved in Wunderthought due to my courseload and Wunderthought's success; however, I still help broker deals whenever I come across a prospective client in need of their services. My time at Wunderthought allowed me to obtain hands-on experience in real world entrepeneurship and for that I will be forever grateful.  </p>

            <p>During my time as a Tutor, I have assisted a multitude students at various grade levels get up to speed in their Math and Computer Science courseload. I've taught anywhere from high school math to college statistics/calculus to excell skills and C++. I've always enjoyed tutoring as I find it helps me reinforce old concepts. In middle school, I spent my office aide periods assisting my then Geometry teacher teach his pre-algebra class. In high school, I spent countless after school hours tutoring AP Calculus and other math courses for the National Honor Society. It's because of those experienced that I continue to tutor to this day. I've found that not only does it help my technical ability, but it also greatly impacts my ability to communicate complex ideas. In my years at the University of Florida, I've noticed that there is often a disconnect between people that are hyper-technically savvy and people who are working towards becoming hyper-technically savvy--specifically, it's in the ability of the teacher to break down technical terms into everyday language that makes all the difference.

        <p>Outside of my workload, I enjoy spending my time being active. I am a member and student of both UF Judo and UF BJJ. Though my experience with martial arts only recently began, I've enjoyed every moment of it. It has provided me with a sense of being present in my day to day life unparalleled by any other sport I've played in the past. I also enjoy playing pickup basketball with friends and exploring the great outdoors with my dog Thor and my girlfriend Jasmine. Though these are the things I do on a frequent/semi-frequent basis, I am always up for trying/playing a new sport/activity/discipline.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">While indoors, I often spend my time reading (favorite books include Hamlet, Walden, Surely you're joking Mr.Feynmen, and more), meditating, or learning online (though this sometimes result in me falling down a youtube rabbit-hole). As far as TV goes, my media diet consists mainly of Game of Thrones, Rick and Morty, and the occasional episode of Bill Maher or John Oliver. </p>
